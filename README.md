## Overview

Contactless button system designed for retrofit installation in slot machines and gaming equipment. 
Developed during the COVID-19 pandemic to eliminate surface contamination while maintaining gaming commission compliance and player experience.

**Deployed commercially in casinos across Cancun and Monterrey, Mexico.**

---

## The Problem

During COVID-19, casino slot machines posed significant contamination risks:
- Thousands of button presses per machine per day
- High-touch surfaces in high-traffic environments
- Existing touchless solutions were prohibitively expensive or required complete machine replacement
- Gaming regulations required specific response times and reliability standards
- Retrofitting existing equipment was essential for casino operators

---

## The Solution

Developed a drop-in touchless proximity sensing system that:
- Detects hand presence without physical contact
- Retrofits existing slot machines without modification
- Maintains gaming commission compliance
- Preserves familiar player experience
- Cost-effective compared to machine replacement

---
